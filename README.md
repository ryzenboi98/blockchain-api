This project represents a Blockchain simulation using the Flask to host and create the API.

## What is a Blockchain?
A Blockchain is a descrentralized system with blocks linked through hashes.

Each block contains, in a generalized view, the following data:
* Transactions
* An integer value of 32-bits aka `nonce`
* The timestamp that the block was added to the chain
* The hash of the previous block
* The hash of the block itself calculated by the data mentioned above
