This project represents a Blockchain simulation using the Flask to host and create the API.

## What is a Blockchain?
A Blockchain is a descrentralized system with blocks linked through hashes.

Each block contains, in a generalized view, the following data:
* Transactions
* An integer value of 32-bits aka __nonce__
* The __timestamp__ when the block was added to the chain
* The __hash of the previous block__
* The __hash__ of the block itself calculated by the data mentioned above
