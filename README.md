# blockchain-api
This project represents a Blockchain simulation using the Flask to host and create the API. 
A Blockchain is a descrentralized with linked blocks. Each block contains, in a generalized view, transactions data, an integer value of 32-bits aka nonce, a timestamp that the block was added to the blockchain and an hash and hash of the previous block. 

All this data is used to calculate each hash of the block which means that any information changed in the blockchain will break the blockchain integrity.
